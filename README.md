hey.

this is basically PyInstaller except for users who dont know how to manually type out the command.

oh and by the way you (obvuisly) need pyinstaller aswell!

enter "pip install PyInstaller" into your terminal.

if something went wrong. dont hesitate to report it in the issues tab. i will try my best to see it and solve the problem.
